 observation.2011.desc.gestalt: "Our advisors are having trouble working with the gestalt consciousness on [From.GetName] in their mission to bring it up to a higher level of technology. It is reluctant to have anything to do with us, and looks upon our scientists with suspicion and disgust.\n\nThis xenophobia has unfortunately upset our timetables - teaching the [From.Owner.GetName] will take longer than expected."
 observation.2013.desc.gestalt: "The primitive gestalt consciousness on [From.GetName] that we are sharing our technology with seems delighted at our presence. Much of its attention is focused on the enclave we have established on the surface, and our scientists are constantly bombarded with questions about our culture and history.\n\nThis eagerness by the [From.Owner.GetName] to learn more about us has accelerated our mission to bring their civilization up to the Space Age. We have revised our initial time estimates."
 observation.2051.desc.gestalt: "Some of the scientists we sent to advice the [From.Owner.GetName] of [From.GetName] have questioned the wisdom of our mission there. They report that the gestalt consciousness only seems interested in obtaining new weapons technology.\n\nIts tiresome efforts to subvert the peaceful technologies we offer it to create instruments of war has unfortunately delayed the progress of our mission."
 observation.2053.desc.gestalt: "Our mission on [From.GetName] to enlighten the native civilization and advance them to the Space Age is not proceeding as planned. For some reason, the [From.Owner.Name] frequently becomes horrified when we try to teach it about new weapons technology.\n\nIt took our scientific advisors weeks to calm it after we showed a simulation illustrating the effects of detonating a fusion bomb over a populated city. This has unfortunately delayed our progress."
 observation.2055.desc.gestalt: "We are having difficulty working with the gestalt consciousness on [From.GetName] in our mission to elevate it barbarism. The [From.Owner.GetName] has proven to be superstitious, and our scientific advisors are often frustrated by its arcane religious practices and stubborn refusal to accept science as fact.\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like our initial time estimates for this mission were too optimistic. It will take longer than expected to civilize the [From.Owner.GetName]."
 observation.2057.desc.gestalt: "Our efforts to enlighten the [From.Owner.GetName] and lead it on the true path towards the stars have been frustrated. The religious advisors and scientists that we sent to [From.GetName] have reported a troubling lack of faith on behalf of the gestalt mind. It is willing to accept our technology readily enough, but not the spiritual lessons required to use it responsibly.\n\nThis has significantly hampered our mission to guide the [From.Owner.GetName] to enlightenment. It will take longer than the signs ordained."
 observation.2059.desc.gestalt: "The oppressive, autocratic society on [From.GetName] has frustrated our efforts to raise the technological level of the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Individual thoughts and initiatives - on which science thrives - are discouraged among the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural].\n\nTheir primitive authoritarianism has stymied the progress of our mission - the scientific advisors we sent report that it will likely take longer than expected."
